This is a little... heh, I don't know what to call it, 'responsive design' project.
In essence, you hover over a button to expand a textbox, then click to post.
Target is use in forums, which is what I intend to do with it.

I know my CSS and JS really aren't great, but it's the idea more than anything.

Use as you like, credit awesome but not required
